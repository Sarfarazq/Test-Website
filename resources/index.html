The task of memorizing rock strata for Earth Science was mind-numbing, so I was delighted to take a break. Hannah and I had known each other in high school, and both of us had been accepted at Washington University in St. Louis.</p>
            <p>&lsquo;There’s a big civil rights march sponsored by the St. Louis Conference on
Religion and Race next weekend,&lsquo; she announced. &lsquo;I want to go, but my sorority sisters
aren’t interested. Would you like to come?&lsquo; she asked.</p>
