Website for Coming Together in Skokie and Niles Township

## Editing events

1. Log in to prose.io
2. Find an event to edit (and open it)

From here you can edit:

- Title
- Description (The description text is the text you will see in the entry.)

You can edit the rest of the even info, by click on the Metadata button, including:

- Location
- Date (note that it must be in this format: yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss -0600)
- Times (this is just text, so times can be weird like 10 a.m. and 2 p.m.)
- Audiences (These are tagged. You can add your own though)
- Event type (one per event)
- Registration url (just paste in the url)

Click "Done" when you're done editing the metadata.

### What is that "raw metadata" thing?

Nothing, pretend you didn't see it.

## Saving your work

Saving your work is the trickiest bit:

1. Click the Save icon (a skeuomorphic floppy disk)
2. Add a commit message (optional)
3. **Click on Commit**

Notice the bold part, it's important. You haven't saved until you commit.
