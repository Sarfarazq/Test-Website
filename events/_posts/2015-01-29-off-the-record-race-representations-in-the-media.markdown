Acts of violence are reported in the media in differing ways, particularly in relation to the communities being reported upon. The many forms of media have radically altered our access to information. Join media scholar Suzanne McBride, journalist Mark Jacob, media literacy advocate Peter Adams, and documentary producer Pemon Rami for a panel discussion of the ways new media affect our understanding of race relations in contemporary society.
