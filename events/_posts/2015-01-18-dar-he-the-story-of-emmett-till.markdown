Making its Chicago premiere, this drama chronicles the lynching, beating and death, trial and acquittal, and then the unbelievable public confession afterwards of the men accused of Emmett Till's murder. This original historical one-man drama was written by Mike Wiley, who also performs all of the roles with transcendent characterization and historical accuracy. *Contains sensitive subject matter.*

Tickets are $10! The event is sponsored by the North Shore Center for the Performing Arts Foundation.
