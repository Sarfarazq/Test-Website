Racism. Hate crimes. Love. Islam. Culture. Language. Life. Five Muslim women in a post-9/11 world serve tea and uncover what lies beneath the veil in this compelling one-woman show by talented writer-actress Rohina Mallik. Performance will be followed by a Q&A with the audience, as well as a book signing by Ms. Mallik.
