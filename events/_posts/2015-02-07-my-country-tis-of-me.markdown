Bring the whole family to this day-long event and celebrate what makes you special and unique!  Every hour on the hour, you can listen to a staff member read the book, *Of Thee I Sing* by Barack Obama.  After listening to the story, help build our community quilt by creating a paper square about what makes you special and putting it up on our wall.  The quilt will be built throughout the day and will remain on display until the end of February.
