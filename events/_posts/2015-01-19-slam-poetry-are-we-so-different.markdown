Write. Speak. Create. Join an artist from Chicago Slam Works, a spoken word performance and teaching group, to learn about slam poetry and poets' abilities to tell moving personal stories. Participants will spend an hour and a half learning about and crafting their own slam poems, and all creations will be recorded at the end of the event.
