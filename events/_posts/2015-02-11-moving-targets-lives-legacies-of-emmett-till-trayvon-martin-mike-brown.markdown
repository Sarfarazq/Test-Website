Keep your hands out of your pockets. Speak in a non-aggressive tone. Announce your movements. Although many people try to sell the idea of a post-racial America, the lives of African-American males are at risk every day. Using the lives of Emmett Till, Trayvon Martin, and Mike Brown, Oakton Community College professor Angelyn Anderson will examine the history of race relations in America, why black lives matter, and how community dialogue will help address this crisis.
