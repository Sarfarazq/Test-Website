A Walk in My Shoes are community events hosted by the Y.O.U Spartans. The purpose is to help our community members have a better understanding of each other through storytelling. 

At our first event, we will be led in our conversation by guest author Torri Stuckey. He will discuss the impact of his book *Impoverished State of Mind, Thinking Outside of da Block.* A self-empowering book for teenagers and young adults living in urban poverty, its premise is that being impoverished is more than just socioeconomic status; it is a state of mind.
