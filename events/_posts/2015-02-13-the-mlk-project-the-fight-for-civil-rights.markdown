The MLK Project is a one-woman show that follows a Chicago student's personal transformation through studying the Civil Rights Movement. Alaya uses her fists as an outlet for anger, but after interviewing local heroes of the Movement she discovers she can put "anger into action" and that her power is in her voice and her hip hop, not violence. Weaving together real interviews, poetry, hip hop, history and multi-media projections the performance features stories of both celebrated and unsung Chicago-based Civil Rights Activists. Written by Yolanda Androzzo.
