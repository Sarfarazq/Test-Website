The integration of America's public schools has been an ongoing process that didn't start (or end) with Brown vs. Board of Education. Join Bennett Johnson, former head of the Evanston NAACP and co-founder of the first Black-owned publishing company in the U.S. (Path Press Inc.), as he shares his experience as an activist working to desegregate schools in Evanston.
