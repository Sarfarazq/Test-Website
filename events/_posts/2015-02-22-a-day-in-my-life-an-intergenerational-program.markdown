Children are invited to bring a beloved adult-parent, grandparent, aunt or uncle, neighbor, or another caregiver - to the library to share stories from our lives.  Children and caregivers will talk about what it was like to be a child at some other time as compared to childhood today, and pairs will create books to capture these stories.  Light refreshments will be served.
